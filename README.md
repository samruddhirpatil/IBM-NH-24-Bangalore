## Project Overview

The **Complaint Management System with Chatbot Integration & Ticket Support Generation** is an intelligent platform designed to streamline the process of logging, managing, and resolving user complaints. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, the system offers a seamless user experience through a smart AI-based chatbot interface. If the chatbot cannot resolve a complaint, it intelligently logs the issue by generating a ticket, categorizing, prioritizing, and assigning it based on its nature and urgency. An admin dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities to ensure efficient resolution of complaints.

**Outcome:**  
A sophisticated complaint management system where users can log and track complaints through an AI-powered chatbot, with an intelligent ticketing system that prioritizes and assigns tasks for faster resolution.

## Features

1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Secure user authentication to create profiles and log in.
   - Ensures data privacy and personalized complaint management.

2. **AI-Powered Chatbot Integration**
   - Serves as the first point of contact for users.
   - Assists in logging complaints, answering FAQs, and guiding users.
   - Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and process user inputs.
   - Provides real-time updates on complaint statuses.

3. **AI-Based Ticketing System**
   - **Automatic Ticket Creation:** Generates tickets automatically upon complaint registration.
   - **Intelligent Categorization:** Categorizes tickets based on predefined categories (e.g., billing, technical, service) using machine learning models.
   - **Prioritization System:** Assigns priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) based on complaint nature and keywords.
   - **Dynamic Assignment:** Intelligently assigns tickets to relevant teams or agents based on expertise, workload, and availability.

4. **Complaint Tracking & Status Updates**
   - Real-time updates on complaint progress via chatbot, email, or SMS.
   - Users can view statuses such as "Registered," "In Progress," "Under Review," or "Resolved."

5. **Admin Dashboard with Analytics**
   - **Ticket Overview:** View all open and resolved tickets, prioritized by urgency.
   - **AI-Assisted Assignment:** Suggests team or agent assignments based on skill sets and current workloads.
   - **Detailed Analytics:** Generates reports on response time, resolution time, number of complaints handled, user satisfaction, and more.
   - **Pattern Identification:** AI identifies recurring issues and suggests improvements.

6. **Notifications & Escalation Mechanism**
   - **Automated Notifications:** Sends updates at key stages (e.g., ticket creation, assignment, progress, resolution).
   - **Escalation Workflow:** Automatically escalates unresolved or high-priority tickets to higher-level management or specialists after a specified time threshold.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js** with **Express.js** for server-side development.
  - **MongoDB** for database management.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js** for building a responsive user interface.

- **AI & Machine Learning:**
  - **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-learn** for developing ML models.
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes **NLTK**, **SpaCy**, and **Dialogflow/Rasa** for understanding and processing user inputs.

- **Chatbot Framework:**
  - **Dialogflow** or **Rasa** for chatbot integration and management.
